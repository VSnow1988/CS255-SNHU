SNHU CS255 - System Analysis

## Final Project
In this class, we went through mock interviews with and collected information about a client, and used that to create a Business Requirements Document for the software solution and presentation about the client and proposed design to meet their needs. The interview process was emphasized, so that I understand just how important it is to ask questions and gather details about what a client wants before deciding on a solution plan. Being thorough in the planning process saves time and money later, ensuring that time is not wasted on creating software that disappoints or does not actually serve a client's needs.
